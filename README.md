# FakeNewsDetection
For this project, by using a [Kaggle fake and real news database](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset), I conducted sentiment analysis on both each article's title and article to detect fake news articles. As of 6/16/21, RandomForest Classifer performed the best (78.76% accuracy). For the next step, I would like to try the algorithms based on TF-IDF. As of 6/18/21, with TF-IDF and RandomForest Classifier, accuracy reached to 99.05%. 

## Dataset
